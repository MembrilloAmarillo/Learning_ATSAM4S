# LEARNING ATMSAM4S
## Introduction

This is going to be a README-like blog. I want to put here all my learning process until the momment. I am not an embedded developer, understand that this is how I learned to programm on this chip. I am sure there are better ways.<br>
And of course, probably part of what is written is wrong, so please, take everything with a grain of salt.

## Special Thanks
[StrawberryHacker](https://github.com/StrawberryHacker) help me a lot since the start of the proccess, and moreover, the 'start_up_code.c' file is written by him.
I use [edbg](https://github.com/ataradov/edbg) to upload my program in the chip. It was a big help, I dont have to use Atmel Studio in any part of the proccess :D

# Process
## Start-Up code
## Main
For now I wanted to make a little main function, that blinks some leds and send through UART some characters.
## GPIO
## UART
